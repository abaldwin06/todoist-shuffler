# todoist-shuffler
Get around decision fatigue by randomly choosing which task to work on next

# How to use this
1. Set up a virtual environment w/ flask and python and this program installed
2. Until I get OAuth set up, find your Todoist API key and add it into the app.py program 
3. Run the flask app and open the correct URL in your browser
4. Set any due date, project or label filters and click the button to find a random task. There is OR logic between the projects if you select multiple, and the same for if you select multiple labels, but there is AND logic in between the due dates, projects, and labels you select.
 
# What I learned
A Flask app to learn how to use python as the back end of a web app. There is no backend database on this app, which will be my next project to exercise what I've learned.
